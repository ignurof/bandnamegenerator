## Features 

The main feature of the website that will really make it stand out in my opinion would be that everything will be handled on one page, as if it were an app.
With the help of JavaScript's DOM Manipulation the website can be built in such a way that the page content will be switched out dynamically and with a smooth transition to ease between two different page's content.
Nice and snappy animated transitions with the help of CSS to really make the website pop and give the user some nice interaction feedback experience.
