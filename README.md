# bandnamegenerator

bandnamegenerator is an interactive band name generation website created to help spread more diverse and unique band names out into the world. The goal of the website is to assist in coming up with new and fresh band names and the main target demograpic would be aspiring founders of new music bands. bandnamegenerator will be a great tool to use while brainstorming band names for beginners but it could be just as useful to experienced bands looking to rebrand themselves.

## Features 

The main feature of the website that will really make it stand out in my opinion would be that everything will be handled on one page, as if it were an app.
With the help of JavaScript's DOM Manipulation the website can be built in such a way that the page content will be switched out dynamically and with a smooth transition to ease between two different page's content.
Nice and snappy animated transitions with the help of CSS to really make the website pop and give the user some nice interaction feedback experience.

### Interaction Experience

I wanted to improve the interaction experience in this project by including things such as animated transitions between page views and powerful feedback when the user interacts with the various input buttons and fields available on the site.
Due to my own time constraints I could not get the right amount of interaction in place for me to consider this site to have a good quality interaction experience so that will have to be revisited at a later date so that it can be improved upon.

The main interaction experience the user will find on this website will be the dynamic switching between page views while staying on the same technical webpage, just like a mobile app would look and feel.
There is also the interactions the user takes to go through the process from start to finish of generating a band name with the help of the website.
A great deal of effort went into making sure input error messages give the user good feedback to whats happening, with realtime processing of user input to accurately display what their input fields are missing.

## Testing 

During the whole development process I have actively tested and previewed the website using Firefox on my laptop and sometimes switching over to an Android phone to check it out on Chrome. I would plan a feature, expect how it should work, implement it and then manually test the feature by going through the motions like a regular user of the website would to see if it would produce the correct results. If the result was not correct, or just something looked off in general like with the styling for example, then I would just iterate on that specific feature or issue until it worked and/or looked correctly before moving on.
You can see some semblance of how my testing process has gone on by looking at the merge request history for the prod branch when I was testing some things on a phone.
This whole process have definitely taught me that testing on different devices and browsers is extremely important!
Just because our browser devtools are showing us it looks responsive and correct, it might infact not be so on the actual devices!
